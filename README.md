# Visualize trilateration using matplotlib.
## Trilateration Theory
### Read everything with a grain of salt because im no expert in mathematics.
#### Requirement's for trilateration. 1. Three reference points of which coordinates are known at all times. 2. Distances between the reference point and the unknown point that you want to find out.
#### First of all we need minimum 3 known points and their (x,y) coordinates, let's call them A,B,C.

### The plot should look something like this. Ofcourse depending on the input.

### Trilateration Use cases
#### Trilateration is used in many real world applications that need positioning including GPS. One project idea i got while working on this project is to track the position where a ping pong ball hits the plate using 3-4 microphones.
